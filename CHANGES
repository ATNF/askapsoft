0.19.3 (4 September 2017)
-------------------------

A patch release just covering the pipeline scripts. The following bugs
are fixed:

 * The number of writers used in the spectral-line imaging when the
   askap_imager is used (DO_ALT_IMAGER=true) is now better
   described. The input parameter NUM_SPECTRAL_CUBES is now
   NUM_SPECTRAL_WRITERS, and the pipeline is better able to handle a
   single output (FITS) cube written by multiple writers.
 * The running of the validation script after continuum source-finding
   now has the $ACES environment variable set correctly. The
   validation script requires it to be set, and when it was
   not set within a user's environment the script could crash.
 * The image-based continuum subtraction script has had two fixes:
   - The cube name was being incorrectly set when the single-writer
     FITS option was used
   - The working directory was the same for all sub-bands for a given
     beam. This could cause issues with casa's ipython log file,
     resulting in jobs crashing with obscure errors.

0.19.2 (24 August 2017)
-----------------------

A patch release that fixes bugs in both the pipeline scripts and
Selavy, as well as a minor one in casdaupload.

Pipeline fixes:
 * The 'contsub' spectral cubes were not being mosaicked. This was
   caused by incorrect handling of the ".fits" suffix (it was being
   added for CASA images, not FITS image).
 * It was possible for the pipeline to attempt to flag an averaged MS
   even if the averaged MS was not being created. The pipeline is now
   more careful about setting its switches to cover this scenario.
 * The continuum validation reports are now automatically (by default)
   copied to a standard location, tagged with the user's ID and
   timestamp of pipeline. This can be turned off by setting
   VALIDATION_ARCHIVE_DIR to "".
 * The spectral imaging jobs were capable of asking for more writers
   than there were cores in the job. The pipeline scripts are now
   careful to check the number of writers, and ensure it is no more
   than the number of workers. The default number of writers has been
   changed to one.
 * The handling of FITS files by the inter-field mosaicking tasks was
   error-prone - files would either not be copied (in the case of a
   single field) or would not be identified correctly (for the
   spectral-line case).

Pipeline improvements:
 * The image size (number of pixels) and cellsize (in arcsec) for the
   continuum cubes can now be given explicitly, and so be allowed to
   differ from the continuum images.
 * Some default cleaning parameters for continuum cube imaging have
   been changed as well.


The following bugs in Selavy have been fixed:
 * There was an issue with the weight-normalisation option in Selavy,
   where the incorrect normalisation was applied if a subsection (in
   particular the first subsection) had no valid pixels present
   (ie. all were masked). The masking is now correctly accounted for.
 * There were bugs that caused memory errors in the spectral-line (HI)
   parameterisation of sources. This code has been improved.
 * The 'fitResults' files were reporting the catalogue twice, and
   producing the same catalogue for all fit types. Additionally, there
   was the possibility of errors if different fit types yielded
   different numbers of components for a given island. 

Finally, the casdaupload utility would fail if presented with a
wildcard that did not resolve to anything. It will now just carry on,
ignoring that particular parameter.


0.19.1 (04 August 2017)
-----------------------

User documentation changes only. No code changes.


0.19.0 (06 July 2017)
---------------------

 new features:

 * linmos now produces mosaicks with correct masking of pixels in
   in both CASA and FITS formats. 

 * linmos can also remove the contribution of the primary beam frequency
   dependence to the Taylor term images. This only applies to Gaussian
   primary beam models.
 
 * Added Selavy support for FITS outputs
 
 * Addition of ACES-OPS module to facilitate controlled dependency between ASKAPsoft and ACES Tools.
 
 * Parallelised the RM Synthesis module in Selavy.
 
 * New Selavy output - a map of the residual emission not covered by the fitted Gaussians in a continuum image.
 
 * Developed patch for casacore's poor handling of the lanczos interpolation method.
 
 * Added support for casdaupload to handle spectral-line catalogues.
 
 * CASDA related Support for new image types.
 
 * Ensure calibration tables are uploaded to CASDA.
 
 * Added support for continuum validation script and results including CASDA upload.
 
 * Improvements to Selavy spectral-line parameterisation.
 
 * Selavy sets spectral index & curvature to a flag-value if not calculated rather than leaving as zero.
 
bug fixes

 *  linmos, reduced memory footprint. A bug was found that was causing a complete
    image cube to accessed, when only the image shape was required. This has been
    fixed.

 * Selavy catalogues occasionally fail CASDA validation due to wide columns - fixed.
 
 * Fixed bug where restore.beam.cutoff value not read from parset when present.
 
 * Added missing beam log output to new imager.
 
 * Improved handling of failed processing and the effect of that on executing final 
   diagnostics/FITSconversion/thumbnails jobs at end of pipeline.
   
 * Use number of beams in footprint rather than assume 36.
 
 * Minor bug fixes

0.18.3 (23 May 2017)
--------------------

This patch release fixes the following bugs in the pipeline scripts:

 * Incorrect indexing of some self-calibration array parameters
 * Better handling of logic in determining the usage of the
   alternative imager.
 * Ensuring the image-based continuum-subtracted cubes are converted
   to FITS and handled by the CASDA upload. Also that this task is
   able to see cubes directly written to FITS by the spectral
   imagers. 
 * Fixing handling of directory names so that extracted artefacts are
   found correctly for FITS conversion.
 * Removal of extraneous inverted commas in the continuum imaging
   jobscript.

Additionally, there is a new parameter USE_CLI, which defaults to true
but allows the user to turn off use of the online services, should
they not be available.

Finally, a number of the default parameters used by the bandpass
calibration and the continuum imaging have been updated, following
extensive commissioning work with the 12-antenna early science
datasets. Here is a list of the changed parameters:
 * NCYCLES_BANDPASS_CAL=50
 * NUM_CPUS_CBPCAL=216
 * BANDPASS_MINUV=200
 * BANDPASS_SMOOTH_FIT=0
 * BANDPASS_SMOOTH_THRESHOLD=3.0
 * NUM_TAYLOR_TERMS=1
 * NUM_PIXELS_CONT=3200
 * CELLSIZE_CONT=4
 * RESTORING_BEAM_CUTOFF_CONT=0.5
 * GRIDDER_OVERSAMPLE=5
 * CLEAN_MINORCYCLE_NITER=4000
 * CLEAN_PSFWIDTH=1600
 * CLEAN_SCALES="[0]"
 * CLEAN_THRESHOLD_MINORCYCLE="[40%, 1.8mJy]"
 * CLEAN_NUM_MAJORCYCLES="[1,8,10]"
 * CLEAN_THRESHOLD_MAJORCYCLE="[10mJy,4mJy,2mJy]"
 * PRECONDITIONER_LIST="[Wiener]"
 * PRECONDITIONER_GAUSS_TAPER="[10arcsec, 10arcsec, 0deg]"
 * PRECONDITIONER_WIENER_ROBUSTNESS=-0.5
 * RESTORE_PRECONDITIONER_LIST="[Wiener]"
 * RESTORE_PRECONDITIONER_GAUSS_TAPER="[10arcsec, 10arcsec, 0deg]"
 * RESTORE_PRECONDITIONER_WIENER_ROBUSTNESS=-2
 * SELFCAL_NUM_LOOPS=2
 * SELFCAL_INTERVAL="[57600,57600,1]"
 * SELFCAL_SELAVY_THRESHOLD=8
 * RESTORING_BEAM_CUTOFF_CONTCUBE=0.5
 * RESTORING_BEAM_CUTOFF_SPECTRAL=0.5

0.18.2 (5 May 2017)
-------------------

This patch release fixes the following bugs in the pipeline scripts:

 * The ntasks-per-node parameter for the continuum subtraction could
   still be more than ntasks for certain parameter settings.
 * When using a subset of the spectral channels, the new imager jobs
   were not configured properly, with some elements trying to use the
   full number of channels.
 * Mosaicking of the image-based-continuum-subtracted cubes was not
   waiting for the completion of the continuum subtraction jobs, so
   would invariably fail to run correctly. 
 * The image-based continuum-subtraction jobs are now run from
   separate directories, so that ipython logs can not conflict.
 * The spectral source-finding job had an error in the image name in
   the parset.
 * Mosaicking of the continuum-cubes now creates separate weights
   cubes for each type of image product.
 * Continuum imaging with the new imager has been improved, fixing
   inconsistencies in the names of images.
 * The PNG thumbnails were not being propagated to the CASDA
   directory. 

The noise map produced by Selavy is now included in the set of
artefacts converted to FITS and sent to CASDA. 

Additionally, the ability to impose a position shift to the model used
in self-calibration has been added, with the aim of supporting
on-going commissioning work.

0.18.1 (13 April 2017)
----------------------

This patch release sees a few bug-fixes to the pipeline scripts:

 * When re-running the pipeline on already-processed data, where the raw input
   data no longer exists in the archive directory, the pipeline was previously
   failing due to it not knowing the name of the MS or the related metadata
   file. It now has the ability to read MS_INPUT_SCIENCE and MS_INPUT_1934 and
   determine the metadata file from that. It will also not try to run jobs that
   depend on the raw data.
 * The new imager used in spectral-line mode can now be directed to create a
   single spectral cube, even with multiple writers, via the
   ALT_IMAGER_SINGLE_FILE and ALT_IMAGER_SINGLE_FILE_CONTCUBE parameters.
 * There have been changes to the defaults for the number of cores for spectral 
   imaging (from 2000 to 200) and the number of cores per node for continuum
   imaging (from 16 to 20), based on benchmarking tests.
 * In addition, the following bugs were fixed:
   - The ntasks-per-node parameter could sometimes be more than ntasks, causing
     a slurm failure.
   - The self-calibration algorithm was not retaining images from the
     intermediate loops.
   - The image-based continuum subtraction script was not finding the correct
     image cube.


0.18.0 (29 March 2017)
----------------------

New features and updates:

 * Scheduling block state changes, in conjunction with a new TOS
  release:
   - The CP manager now monitors the transition from EXECUTING to
     OBSERVED, and the ICE interfaces have been updated accordingly.
   - The pipeline will now transition the scheduling block state from
     OBSERVED to PROCESSING at the beginning of processing. This will
     only be done for scheduling blocks in the OBSERVED state, and
     will apply to both the science field and the bandpass calibrator.
 * Python libraries:
   - 3rdParty python libraries have been updated to current
     versions. This applies to: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pywcs, pytz,
     and APLpy. The current astropy package has been added, and pyfits
     has been removed. The python scripts in Analysis/evaluation have
     been updated to be consistent with these new packages.
   - There is a new script in Analysis/evaluation,
     makeThumbnailImage.py, that produces grey-scale plots of
     continuum images, and has the capability to add weights contours
     and/or continuum components. This script is used by the
     makeThumbnails script in the pipeline, as well as the new
     diagnostics script (that produces more complex plots aimed at
     being aids for quality analysis).
 * Calibration & Imaging changes:
   - The residual image is now the residual at the end of the last
     major cycle. (Previously, it was the residual at the beginning of
     the last major cycle.)
   - The residual images now have units of Jy/beam rather than
     Jy/pixel, and have the restoring beam written to the header.
   - When the "restore preconditioner" option is used in imaging, the
     residual and psf.image are also written out for this
     preconditioner.
 * Pipeline updates:
   - There is a new pipeline parameter, CCALIBRATOR_MINUV, that allows
     the bandpass calibration to exclude baseline below some value.
   - Minor errors and inconsistencies in some catalogue specifications
     have been fixed, with the polarisation catalogue being updated to
     v0.7.
   - The spectral-line catalogue has been added to the CASDA upload part
     of the pipeline, and has been renamed to incorporate the image name
     (in the line of other data products).
   - There are new pipeline parameters SELFCAL_REF_ANTENNA &
     SELFCAL_REF_GAINS that allow the self-calibration to use a
     reference antenna and/or gain solution.
   - A weights cutoff for Selavy can now be specified via the config
     file using the new parameters SELAVY_WEIGHTS_CUTOFF &
     SELAVY_SPEC_WEIGHTS_CUTOFF (rather than using the linmos cutoff
     value).
   - The new imager is better integrated into the pipeline, with
     DO_ALT_IMAGER parameters for CONT, CONTCUBE & SPECTRAL.
   - It is possible to make use of the direct FITS output in the
     pipeline, by using IMAGETYPE_ parameters for CONT, CONTCUBE &
     SPECTRAL. Note that this is still somewhat of a
     work-in-progress.

Bug fixes:

 * Casacore v2 had several patches added that had been left out of the
   upgrade. Notably a patch allowing the use of the SIGMA_SPECTRUM
   measurement set column following concatenation of measurement
   sets.
 * The mssplit utility has been made more robust with memory allocation
   when splitting large datasets.
 * Better checking of the size of SELFCAL- and imaging-related arrays
   in the pipeline configuration, particularly when not using
   self-calibration.
 * [Weights bug in Selavy]
 * The continuum-subtracted cubes were not being mosaicked by the
   pipeline.
 * The pipeline is more robust against errors encountered when
   obtaining the metadata at the beginning. It can better detect when
   a corrupted metadata file is present, and re-run the extraction of
   that metadata.
 * An error in handling the beam numbering for non-zero beam numbers
   was identified & fixed.
 * The pipeline Selavy jobs were using the incorrect weights cutoff,
   leading to them not searching the full extent of the image.
 * The use of the PURGE_FULL_MS flag in the pipelines will now not
   trigger the re-splitting (and subsequent processing) of the
   full-resolution dataset.


0.17.0 (24 February 2017)
-------------------------

New features:

 * Capability for direct FITS output from imager. The "fits" imagetype
   is now supported for cimager and imager. This should be considered "beta"
   as the completeness of the header information for post processing has not
   been confirmed. This enables the parallel write of FITS cubes which considerably
   improves the performance of spectral line imaging.
 * Selavy's RM Synthesis module can export the Faraday Dispersion
   Function to an image on disk.
 * New source-finding capabilities in the processing pipelines, with a
   spectral-line source-finding task added (using Selavy), and the
   option of RM Synthesis done in the continuum source-finding.
 * The full-resolution measurement set can be purged by the pipeline
   when no longer needed (ie. after the averaging has been done, and
   if no spectral-line imaging is required). This will help to
   minimise unncessary disk-space usage.
 * CASDA upload is now able to handle extracted spectral data products
   (object spectra and moment maps etc) that are produced by the
   source-finding tasks.
 * A few relatively minor additions have been made to the pipeline
   scripts:
   - A minimum UV distance can be applied to the bandpass calibration.
   - The checks done on the self-calibration parameters are less
     restrictive and less prone to give warning messages.
   - Mosaicking at the top level (combining FIELDs) is now not done
     when there is only a single FIELD.
 * User documentation has been updated to better reflect the current
   arrangements with Pawsey (e.g. host names and web addresses). It
   also describes new modules that are available, as well as
   alternative visualisation options using Pawsey's zeus cluster.

Bug fixes:

 * Imaging:
   - The brightness units in the restored images from the new imager are
     now correctly assigned (they were 'Jy/pixel' and are now
     'Jy/beam'). The beam is also now written correctly.
   - The beam logs (recording the restoring beam at each channel of an
     image cube) are now read correctly - previously the comment line
     at the start was not being ignored.
   - A number of fixes for the spectral line imaging mode of "imager"
     have been implemented. These fix issues with zero channels caused
     by flagging.
 * Analysis:
   - The Faraday Dispersion function in Selavy's RM Synthesis module
     was being incorrectly normalised. It is now normalised by the
     model Stokes I flux at the reference frequency.
 * Pipelines:
   - When using more than one Taylor term in the imaging, the continuum
     subtraction with cmodel images was not working correctly, with
     incomplete subtraction. This was due to a malformed parset
     generated within the pipeline. This has been fixed, and the
     continuum subtraction works as expected.
   - The beam logs are now correctly passed to Selavy for accurate
     flux correction of extracted spectra.
   - Job dependencies for the mosaicking and source-finding jobs have
     been fixed, so that all jobs start when they are intended to. The
     mosaicking jobs now only start when they are needed, to avoid
     wasting resources.
   - The project ID was incorrectly obtained from the schedblock
     service when there was more than one word in the SB alias.
   - The SELAVY_POL_WRITE_FDF parameter was incorrectly described in
     the documentation - it has been renamed
     SELAVY_POL_WRITE_COMPLEX_FDF.


0.16.1 (16 December 2016)
-------------------------

A patch release that is largely bug fixes, with several minor
updates to the pipeline scripts.

New features:

 * The pipelines will now accept a list of beams to be processed, via
   a comma-separated list of beams and beam ranges - for instance
   0,1,4,7-9,16. This should be given with the BEAMLIST configuration
   parameter. If this is not given, it falls back to using BEAM_MIN &
   BEAM_MAX as usual.
 * An additional column is now written to the stats files, showing the
   starting time of each job.
 * There is a new parameter FOOTPRINT_PA_REFERENCE that allows a user
   to specify a reference rotation angle for the beam footprint,
   should it not be included in the scheduling block parset.
 * There is a new parameter NCHAN_PER_CORE_SPECTRAL_LINMOS that
   determines how many cores are used for the spectral-line
   mosaicking. This helps ensure that the job is sized such that the
   memory load is spread evenly.

Bug fixes:

 * Imaging:
   - Improvements to the new imager to handle writers who do not get
     work due to the barycentring.
   - Improvements to the allocation of work within the new imager.
 * RM Synthesis & Selavy:
   - The new RM Synthesis module was not correctly respecting the '%p'
     wildcard in image names, which also affected extraction run from
     within Selavy. This has been fixed.
 * Pipelines:
   - The findBandpass slurm job had a bug that stopped it completing
     successfully.
   - A number of bugs were identified with the mosaicking:
     + The Taylor term parameter was set incorrectly in the continuum
       mosaicking scripts.
     + The image name was not being set correctly in the spectral-line
       mosaicking.
     + The job dependencies for the spectral-line mosaicking have been
       fixed so that all spectral imaging jobs are included.
   - The askapsoft module is now loaded more reliably within the slurm
     jobs.
   - The return value of the askapcli tasks is now tested, so that
     errors (often due to conflicting modules) can be detected and the
     pipeline aborted.
   - A certain combination of parameters (IMAGE_AT_BEAM_CENTRES=false
     and DO_MOSAIC=false) meant that the determination of fields in
     the observation was not done, so no science processing was
     done. This has been fixed so that the list of fields is always
     determined.
   - A couple of bugs in the source-finding script were fixed, where
     the image name was incorrectly parsed, and the Taylor 1 & 2
     images were not being found.
   - The footprint position angle for individual fields was
     incorrectly being added to the default value listed in the
     scheduling block parset.
   - To avoid conflicts between source-finding results of different
     images, the artefacts produced by selavy (catalogues and images)
     now incorporate the image name in their name. The source-finding
     jobs are also more explicit in which image they are searching.
   - Finally, two deprecated scripts have been removed from the
     pipeline directory.


0.16.0 (28 November 2016)
-------------------------

A release with a number of bug fixes, new features, and updates to the
pipeline scripts

New features:

 * Rotation Measure synthesis is now possible within the Selavy
   source-finder. This extracts Stokes spectra from continuum cubes at
   the positions of identified continuum components, performs RM
   Synthesis, and creates a catalogue of polarisation properties for
   each component. While still requiring some development, most
   features are available and should permit testing.
 * The new imager, which was made available in an earlier release, has
   been added to the askapsoft module at Pawsey.

Bug fixes for processing software:

 * The bandpass calibrator cbpcalibrator will now not allow through a
   bandpass table with NaN values in it. If NaNs appear in solving the
   bandpass, then cbpcalibrator will throw an exception. In the
   process, the GSL library used in 3rdParty has been updated to v1.16.
 * The writing of noise maps by Selavy (in the VariableThreshold case)
   has been streamlined, so that making such maps for large cubes is
   more tractable.

Pipeline updates:

 * The driving script for the ASKAP pipeline is now called
   processASKAP.sh, instead of processBETA.sh. The latter is still
   available, but gives a warning before callling processASKAP.sh. All
   interfaces remain the same.
 * Linear mosaicking has been improved:
   - It is now available for spectral-line and continuum cubes, in
     addition to continuum images.
   - Mosaics are made for each field, and for each tile if the
     observation was done with the "tilesky" mode.
   - The continuum mosaicking can also include mosaics of the
     self-calibration loops.
 * The pipelines make better use of the online services of ASKAP, to
   determine things like the footprint (location of beams). This makes
   calculations more internally self-consistent.
 * When running self-calibration, some parameters can be given
   different values for each loop. This includes parameters for the
   cleaning, the source-finding, and the calibration. More flexibility
   is also provided for the source-finding within the self-calibration.
 * Processing of BETA datasets are made possible via an IS_BETA
   parameter, which avoids using the online system to obtain beam
   locations, and changes the defaults for the data location.
 * Smoothing of the bandpass solutions is now possible, using a script
   in the ACES repository to produce a new calibration table. It also
   allows plotting of the calibration solutions.
 * More flexibility is allowed for the number of cores used in the
   continuum imaging.
 * A notable bug was fixed that led to incorrect calibration and
   continuum-subtraction when Taylor-terms were being produced
   (i.e. nterms>1)
 * Various other more minor bug fixes, related to logging, stats
   files, and default values of parameters (for instance, the default
   for cmodel was to use a flux cutoff that was too high).


0.15.2 (26 October 2016)
------------------------

This is a patch release that fixes several issues:

 * The parallel linear mosaicking tool linmos-mpi has been patched to
   correct a bug that was initialising cube slices incorrectly.
 * Several fixes to the CP manager and the pipeline scripts were made
   following end-to-end testing with the full ASKAP online system:
   * The CP manager will send notifications to a nominated JIRA ticket
     upon SB state changes.
   * Several fixes were made to the CASDA uploading and polling
     scripts, to ensure accurate execution. The capability of sending
     notifications to a JIRA ticket has also been added.
   * The Project ID is now taken preferentially from the SB, rather
     than the config file.
   * The linear mosaicking in the pipelines is now not turned off when
     only a single beam is processed.


0.15.1 (19 October 2016)
------------------------

This is a patch release that fixes a couple of issues:

 * The bandpass calibrator cbpcalibrator has had its run-time improved
   by changing the way the calibration table is written. It is now
   written in one pass at the completion of the task - this reduces
   the I/O overhead and greatly reduces the run-time for larger
   datasets.
 * The pipeline settings for the flagging have been changed. The
   default settings now are to have the integrate_spectra option
   switched on, and the integrate_times and flat amplitude options
   switched off. This is the same approach as used in 0.14.0-p2 and
   earlier, and so should avoid the case of most of the dataset being
   flagged (as was seen with ADE data using the default settings in
   0.15.0).
 * The flagging step for the average dataset now uses a different
   check-file to the full-size dataset flagging.


0.15.0 (10 October 2016)
------------------------
This release sees a number of bugs fixes and improvements.

* Improved the efficiency of the msmerge operation by allowing the
  writing of arbitrary tile-sizes and the mssplit by forcing bulk
  read operations from the source measurement set when possible.
* To be consistent with changes made to Cimager (ASKAPSDP-1607),
  Simager has been changed to only access cross-correlations.
* Parallel linmos - a new application linmos-mpi with the same
  interface as linmos has been added. This will distribute the channels
  of the cube between mpi ranks and process them separately. Writing each
  channel to the output cube individually. This should allow a full
  resolution cube to be mosaicked.
* Improved Selavy HI emission catalogue, with a more complete set of
  parameters available. This is now turned on by an input parameter
  Selavy.HiEmissionCatalogue.
* JIRA notification for Scheduling Block status changes.
* Pipeline updates:
  - The bandpass calibration approach has changed slightly. All beams
    of the calibrator will be processed up to the requested BEAM_MAX -
    the BEAM_MIN parameter only applies to the science dataset.
  - There is more flexibility in specifying flagging thresholds for
    the dynamic flagger. Each instance of the flagging can have
    different thresholds for the integrateSpectra & integrateTimes
    options, and both of these are now available for the bandpass
    calibrator.
  - When uploading to CASDA and upon successful ingest into CASDA, the
    SB state can be transitioned through the state model.
  - Initial support for the new imager.
* Modified CBPCALIBRATOR to reference the XX and the YY visibilities
  independently to the XX and YY of the reference antenna.
* Added ability to playback in any number of loops in Correlator
  and TOS Simulators.

Bug fixes:
 * Pipelines:
   - When components were used in the pipeline for self-calibration or
     continuum subtraction, the reference direction was not being
     interpreted correctly, leading to erroneous positions.
   - The bandpass calibration table was not inheriting the complete
     path to it - it is now put in a standard location and all scripts
     correctly point to it.
   - More robustness added to the source-finding job so that it
     doesn't run if the FITS conversion fails.
 * Documentation fixes to names of the MS utility functions.
 * Fixing casdaupload to handle images that don't have associated
   thumbnails, and to set the correct write permissions of the upload
   directory.
 * Selavy's extraction of moment maps and cubelets was not working
   correctly when a subsection was given to Selavy. These calculations
   have also been improved slightly to better handle the spectral
   increments.
 * Minor-fixes to new imager to deal with brittle logic in the channel
   allocations in spectral line mode. My fix for this essentially gives
   all the workers the same info as the master.


0.14.0-p2 (25 September 2016)
-----------------------------

A further update only to the pipeline processing:

 * Changes to the directory structure created by the pipeline. Each
   field in the MS is given its own directory, within which processing
   on all beams is done. The bandpass calibrator likewise gets its own
   directory. All files & job names are now identified by the field
   and the beam IDs.
 * Flagging of the science data is now done differently. The MS is
   first bandpass-calibrated, and then flagged. After averaging, there
   is the option to run the flagging again on the averged data. The
   flagging for the bandpass calibrator has not been changed.
 * The dynamic flagging for the science data also allows the use of
   both integrateSpectra and integrateTimes, with the former no longer
   done by default.
 * Modules are loaded correctly by the scripts and slurm jobs before
   particular tasks are used, so that the scripts are less reliant on
   the user's environment.
 * Better handling of metadata files, particularly if a previous
   metadata call had failed.
 * The FITS conversion and thumbnail tasks correctly interact with the
   different fields, and the thumbnail images make a better
   measurement of the image noise, taking into account any masked
   regions from the associated weights images.
 * The cleaning parameter Clean.psfwidth is exposed to the
   configuration file.
 * Bugs in associating the footprint information with the correct
   field have been fixed.
 * If the CASDA-upload script is used to prepare data for deposit, the
   scheduling block state is transitioned to PENDINGARCHIVE.



0.14.0-p1 (9 September 2016)
----------------------------

An update to the pipeline processing only:

 * Fixing a bug in the handling of multiple FIELDs within a
   measurement set. These are now correctly given their own directory
   for the processed data products.
 * The footprint parameters are now preferentially determined from the
   scheduling block parset (using the 'schedblock' command-line
   utility). If not present, the scripts fall back to using the config
   file inputs.
 * The metadata files (taken from mslist, schedblock and footprint.py)
   are re-used on subsequent runs of the pipeline, rather than
   re-running each of these tools.
 * The default bucketsize for the mssplit jobs has been increased to
   1MB, and made configurable by the user. The stripe count for the
   non-data directories has also been changed to 1.


0.14.0 (11 August 2016)
-----------------------

A major release, with several new features and improvements for both
the imaging software and the pipeline scripts.

A new imager in under test in this release, currently just called
"imager" and it has the following features:

 * In continuum mode it allows a core to process more than one channel.
   This has a small cost in memory and a proportional increase in disk
   access. But allows the continuum imaging to proceed with a much smaller
   footprint on the cluster. This will allow simultaneous processing of all
   beams in a coming release.
 * Spectral line cubes can be made from measurement sets that are from different
   epochs. The epochs are imaged separately but merged into the same image for
   minor-cycle solving.
 * The output spectral line cubes can be in the barycentric frame. This is currently
   just nearest neighbour indexing. But the possibility of interpolation has not been
   designed out.
 * The concept of "multiple writers" has been introduced to improve the disk access
   pattern for the spectral line mode.  This breaks up the cube into frequency bands.
   These can be recombined post-processing.
 * If you really want to increase the performance for many major cycles you can
   also turn on a shared memory option which stores visibility sets in memory throughout
   processing.
 * The imager takes the same parset as Cimager - but extra key-value pairs are required to implement
   the features.

This new imager is still under test and we have not added the hooks into the pipeline yet.

Other updates to the imaging code include:
 * Simager is now more robust against completely-flagged
   channels - such channels will now be set to zero in the output
   cube, instead of failing the simager job.
 * The extraction of spectra done by Selavy is now more robust and
   better able to handle multiple components and distributed
   processing.
 * Selavy now accepts a reference direction when providing a
   components parset - the l & m coordinates are calculated relative
   to this, rather than the image centre.
 * The restore solver can now accept its own preconditioner
   parameters, in addition to the general parameters used by the
   other solvers. If specified, a second set of restored images
   will be written with suffix ".alt.restored".

The pipeline scripts have seen the following updates:
 * There is a new option to have a different image centre for each
   beam, rather than a common pixel grid for all images. This uses the
   beam centre location taken from the footprint.py utility (an
   external task in the ACES subversion area).
 * The self-calibration can now use cmodel to generate a model image,
   instead of using a components parset.
 * There are new tasks to:
   - Apply the gains calibration to the averaged measurement set
   - Image the averaged measurement set as "continuum cubes", in
     multiple polarisations
   - Apply an image-based continuum-subtraction following the creation
     of the spectral-line cubes. This makes use of an ACES python
     script to fit a low-order polynomial to each spectrum in the
     cube.
  * The headers of the FITS files created by the pipelines now have a
    wider range of metadata, including observatory and date-obs
    keywords, as well as information about the askapsoft & pipeline
    versions.
  * The restore preconditioner options mentioned above are available
    through RESTORE_PRECONDITIONER_ parameters, for the continuum
    imaging only (it is not implemented for simager).
  * Several bugs were fixed:
    - The continuum subtraction was failing when using components if
      no sources were found - it now skips the continuum subtraction
      step.
    - The askapdata module was, in certain situations, not loaded
      correctly, leading to somewhat cryptic errors in the imaging.
    - The parsing of mslist to obtain MS metadata would sometimes
      fail, depending on the content of the MS. It is now much more
      robust.
    - The default for TILENCHAN_SL has been increased to 10, to
      counter issues with mssplit running slow.


0.13.2 (19 July 2016)
---------------------

This bug-fix version addresses a few issues with the imaging &
source-finding code, along with minor updates to the pipeline
scripts.
The following bugs have been fixed in the processing software:
 * Caching of the Wiener preconditioner is now done, so that the
   weights are only calculated once for all solvers and the filters
   are only calculated once for all major cycles, scales &
   Taylor-terms. This has the effect of greatly speeding up the
   imaging, particularly for large image sizes.
 * The BasisfunctionMFS solver has had the additional convolution with
   the PSF removed. This fixes a bug where central sources were being
   cleaned preferentially to sources near the edge of the image.
   It also improves the resolution and SNR of minor-cycle dirty images.
 * From the update to casacore-2 in 0.13.0, linmos would fail when
   mosaicking images without restoring beams. This has been fixed (and
   behaves as it did prior to 0.13.0).
 * The size check in Selavy that rejects very large fitted components
   has been re-instated. This should allow the rejection of spurious
   large fitted components. The minimum size requirement (which forced
   sizes to be >60% of the PSF) has been removed.

And the pipeline has seen these fixes:
 * The resolution of the input science measurement set, when not given
   explicitly in the config file, is now done properly in all cases,
   rather than just for the case of splitting & flagging.
 * The pipeline now allows clipping in the snapshot option of the
   gridding - this improves performance at high declinations, where
   different warping between snapshots could introduce sharp edges to
   the weights image.
 * The pipeline also allows the use of a weights cutoff in the Selavy
   job used in self-calibration, to avoid the presence of these sharp
   cutoffs seen at high declinations.


0.13.1 (24 June 2016)
---------------------

This bug-fix version primarily addresses issues with the processing
pipelines. The following bugs have been fixed:
 * Non-integer image cell sizes were not being interpreted
   correctly. These values can now be any decimal value.
 * A change in the mslist output format with casacore v2 meant that
   the Cmodel continuum subtraction script was not reading the correct
   reference frequency. This caused the cmodel job to fail for the
   case of nterms>1. The parsing code has been fixed.
 * The archiving scripts had a few changes:
   - The resolution of filenames & paths has been fixed.
   - The source-finding is now run on FITS versions of the images
   - The catalogue keys in the observation.xml are now internally
     consistent.
   - The way thumbnail sizes are specified in the pipeline
     configuration file has changed slightly.

Related to the above changes, the C++ code has had a couple of
changes:
 * casdaupload now correctly puts the thumbnail information in the
 <image> group in the observation.xml file.
 * Fixes were made to the Selavy VOTable output to fix formatting
 errors that were preventing it passing validation upon CASDA ingest.

Other C++ code changes include:
 * Fixes to the output files from the crossmatch utility.
 * Updates to the slice interfaces for compatibility with the TOS.

The documentation has also been updated, with updated descriptions of
parameters that have changed as a result of the above, a few typos
fixed, and new information about the management of data on Pawsey's
scratch2 filesystem.

0.13.0 (31 May 2016)
--------------------

This version fixes a few issues with the processing pipelines, fixes
some bugs with the source-finder and casda upload utility, and moves
the underlying code to use version 2 of the casacore package.

The pipeline scripts have seen the following changes:
 * The requested times for the slurm jobs are now individually
 configurable via parameters in the processBETA config file.
 * The Pawsey account can be explicitly given, allowing the use of the
 scripts under other accounts on magnus.
 * The linmos job now properly checks the CLOBBER parameter, and will
 avoid over-writing mosaicked images if CLOBBER=false.
 * There is now an archiving option to the pipeline, which includes:
   - conversion of images to FITS format
   - creation of PNG 'thumbnail' versions of the 2D images
   - staging of data to a directory for ingest into CASDA

The processing software had the following changes:
 * The casacore package has been updated to version 2.0.3, with
 corresponding changes throughout the ASKAPsoft code tree.
 * NOTE that this has resulted in the code not building on OS X
 Mavericks (10.9).
 * The Selavy sourcefinder had two changes:
   - Errors on the fitted parameters are now reported in the component
   catalogue.
   - A bug that stopped Selavy running the variable-threshold option
   when the SNR image name was not specified has been fixed.
 * The casdaupload utility now requires the observation start and end
 times to be specified if no measurement set is provided.


0.12.2 (24 May 2016)
--------------------

A bug fix release for the processing pipeline.
This fixes a problem where the mosaicking task was still assuming beam
IDs that had a single integer - ie. it was looking for
image.beam0.restored instead of image.beam00.restored.


0.12.1 (18 May 2016)
--------------------

This is a simple patch release that fixes a couple of bugs, one of
which affected the performance of both the source-finder and the
pipelines.

The measurement of spectral indices for fitted components to continuum
Taylor-term images was being done incorrectly, leading to erroneous
values for spectral-index and spectral-curvature. This, in turn, could
lead to inaccuracies or even failures in the continuum-subtraction
task of the pipeline (when the CONTSUB_METHOD=Cmodel option was used).
This only affected version 0.12.0 (released on 8 May 2016), and is
fully corrected in 0.12.1.

The other bug enforces the total number of channels processed by the
pipelines to be an exact multiple of the averaging width
(NUM_CHAN_TO_AVERAGE). In previous versions, the pipeline scripts
would press on, but this would potentially result in errors in the
slurm files and jobs not executing. Now, should NUM_CHAN_TO_AVERAGE
not divide evenly into the number of channels requested, the script
will exit with an error message before submitting any jobs.

0.12.0 (8 May 2016)
-------------------

This version has a number of changes to the processing applications
and the pipeline scripts.

Bugs that have been fixed in the processing applications include:
* The deconvolution major cycles were using out-of-date residual
 values when logging and testing against the threshold.majorcycle
 parameter. This is now fixed.
* The initialisation of calibrator input now depends more closely on
the input parameters nAnt, nBeam & the calibrator model, rather than
the first chunk of the data - this allows the shape of the data cube
to change throughout the dataset (which will help with data imported
from MIRIAD/CASA).
* Simager was showing a cross-shaped artefact when Wiener
preconditioning was used, even with the preservecf parameter set to
true. This parameter is now recognised, and the artefact is no longer
seen.
* Full polarisation handling is now possible with simager (in the same
manner as for cimager).
* Simager was crashing when no preconditioner was given - this has
been fixed.
* The casdaupload task now conforms to the current CASDA requirements
of allowing multiple SBIDs, and of reporting the image type.
* Selavy's Gaussian fitting is now more able to fit confused
components that are not immediately identified from the initial
estimates.
* Selavy was also failing when given images of a particular name
(short, without a full-stop). This has been fixed.

The pipeline scripts have had a number of improvements:
* They are more robust for processing ADE data, with >9 beams and >6
antennas.
* The flagging tasks have been improved, with:
 - Flagging of autocorrelations an option
 - The selection flagger (that does antenna-based & autocorrelations)
 is done first, along with (an optional) flat amplitude threshold.
 - The dynamic flagging is done as the second pass
 - There is more user control over these individual elements
* New parameters are available in the scripts, to make use of the
snapshotimaging.longtrack parameter in the gridding, and
normalisegains option in the self-calibration. The latter improves the
performance of the self-calibration, approximating phase-only
self-calibration.
* The slurm jobfiles are now more robust to the user's environment -
if the askapsoft module has not been loaded, it will be in the
jobfile, and the user can request a different version.


0.11.2 (28 March 2016)
----------------------

This release is a relatively small bug-fix update, primarily fixing a
bug in cimager.

This bug would prevent a parallel job completing in the case of the
major cycle threshold being reached prior to the requested maximum
number of major cycles.

Other changes include:
* The pipeline scripts have a few minor fixes to the code to improve
reliability, and ensure the correct number of cores used for jobs is
reported in the statistics files.
* The only change to the ingest pipeline (within askapservices)
incorporates an extra half-cycle wait following fringe-rotator
update.


0.11.1 (8 March 2016)
---------------------

The imaging software now incorporates the preservecf option (released
in 0.11.0) into the SphFunc gridder, and introduces a new option to
the gridding - snapshotimaging.longtrack - that predicts the best fit
W plane used for the snapshot imaging, finding the plane that
minimises the future deviation in W. This can have substantial savings
in processing time for long tracks.

The pipeline scripts have seen a number of minor improvements and
fixes, with improved alternative methods for continuum subtraction,
and improved reporting of resource usage (including a record of the
number of cores used for each job). The user configuration file is now
also copied to a timestamped version for future reference.

The ingest pipeline code has incorporated changes resulting from the
recent commissioning activities.


0.11.0 (15 February 2016)
-------------------------

A key change made in the processing software relates the
preconditioning. There is a new parameter preconditioning.preservecf
that should be set to true for the case of using WProject and the
Wiener preconditioner. This has fixed a couple of issues - at low
(negative) robustness values, the cross-shaped artefact that was
sometimes seen has now gone, and the performance should now more
closely match that expected from robust weighting for the full range
of robustness values.

Several other bugs were fixed:
* Linmos had a bug (that was introduced in version 0.10) where
automatically-generated primary beams were being set to the position
of the first image.
* The multiscale-MFS solver had a small bug that would lead to
higher-order terms being preconditioned multiple times
* Cmodel had bugs related to the reading of Selavy catalogues, and
correctly representing deconvolved Gaussians. It now works correctly
with such data
* Simager would fail were no preconditioners supplied.
* Selavy now better handles images that do not have spectral axes (an
issue when dealing with images made by packages other than
ASKAPsoft).

Additionally, the regridding has been sped up through a patch to the
casacore library.

The pipeline scripts also have a new feature, making use of Selavy +
Cmodel to better perform the continuum subtraction from spectral-line
data. The old approach is still available, but is not the default.


0.10.1 (18 January 2016)
------------------------

Much of this release relates to updates to the ingest pipeline and
related tasks, in preparation for getting it running at Pawsey. These
are now deployed as their own module, although it is not expected that
ACES members will need to use this.

In the science processing area, an important fix was made to the code
responsible for uvw rotations. A fault was identified where these were
being projected into the wrong frame, which could lead to positional
offsets in images made away from the initial phase centre. This fault
has been fixed.

Some initial fixes to the preconditioner have been made that may
improve images when Wiener filtering with a low or negative robustness
parameter. Improvements are only expected when snapshot imaging is not
being used. A full fix is being tested and is planned for the next
release.

This release also sees the BETA pipeline scripts move into an
askapsoft-derived module (although this had previously been
announced).


0.9.0 (12 October 2015)
-----------------------

There are only a small number of changes to the core processing part
of the software that would affect ACES work on galaxy, and these are
almost all to do with the source-finder Selavy. The default values of
some parameters governing output files have changed, with the
preference now to minimise the number of output files. A few
corrections have been made to the units of parameters in some of the
output catalogues.


0.8.1 (10 September 2015)
-------------------------

This release introduces simager, the prototype spectral-line imager -
this allows imaging of large spectral cubes through distributed
processing, and is capable of creating much larger cubes than
cimager. While this is not the final version of the spectral-line
imager - the software framework that underpins the imaging code is
going through a re-design prior to early science - it does demonstrate
the distributed-processing approach that enables large numbers of
spectral channels to be processed.

For those wanting to make use of the ACES scripts under subversion,
these will be updated shortly to include use of simager.

Other changes to the askapsoft module include minor updates to the
CASDA HI catalogue interface from the Selavy sourcefinder, and
ADE-related updates to the ingest pipeline and associated tools (which
won’t affect work on galaxy).


0.7.3 (21 August 2015)
----------------------

This release has a few relatively small bug fixes that have been
resolved in the past week:
* a minor fix to cimager that solves a rare problem with the
visibility metadata statistics calculations, that would result in
cimager failing (this had been seen in processing the basic continuum
tutorial data).
* correcting the shape (BMAJ/BMIN/BPA) parameters in the
Selavy-generated component parset output (that might be used as input
to ccalibrator in self-calibration) - they were previously given in
arcsec/degrees rather than radians (as required by
ccalibrator/csimulator).
* aligning the cmodel VOTable inputs with the new Selavy output
formats
* a fix to the units in one of the Selavy VOTable outputs


0.7.2 (9 August 2015)
---------------------

This release is a bug-fix release aimed at fixing a problem identified
in running the basic continuum imaging tutorial. There was an issue
with the way the simulated data had been created, which meant that
mssplit would fail on those measurement sets. This has been fixed
(fixing both mssplit and msmerge), and the tutorial dataset and
description have been updated.

If you use mssplit on real BETA data, you will not notice any
difference, save for potentially a small performance improvement.

The only other change has been implementation of the CASDA format for
absorption-line catalogues, although the implementation of actual
absorption-line searching is not complete in Selavy, so this will
probably not affect any of you (it has been more to provide early
examples for use by the CASDA team).


0.7.0 (3 July 2015)
