0.15.0 (nn October 2016)
-----------------------------
This release sees a number of bugs fixes and improvements.

* Improved the efficiency of the msmerge operation by allowing the 
  writing of arbitrary tile-sizes and the mssplit by forcing bulk 
  read operations from the source measurement set when possible.
* To be consistent with changes made to Cimager (ASKAPSDP-1607), 
  Simager has been changed to only access cross-correlations.
* Improved Selavy HI emission catalogue.
* Improvements to Selavy moment-map calculations.
* Improvements to the cubelet extraction in Selavy.
* Various minor bug fixes.

0.14.0-p2 (25 September 2016)
-----------------------------

A further update only to the pipeline processing:

 * Changes to the directory structure created by the pipeline. Each
   field in the MS is given its own directory, within which processing
   on all beams is done. The bandpass calibrator likewise gets its own
   directory. All files & job names are now identified by the field
   and the beam IDs.
 * Flagging of the science data is now done differently. The MS is
   first bandpass-calibrated, and then flagged. After averaging, there
   is the option to run the flagging again on the averged data. The
   flagging for the bandpass calibrator has not been changed.
 * The dynamic flagging for the science data also allows the use of
   both integrateSpectra and integrateTimes, with the former no longer
   done by default. 
 * Modules are loaded correctly by the scripts and slurm jobs before
   particular tasks are used, so that the scripts are less reliant on
   the user's environment.
 * Better handling of metadata files, particularly if a previous
   metadata call had failed.
 * The FITS conversion and thumbnail tasks correctly interact with the
   different fields, and the thumbnail images make a better
   measurement of the image noise, taking into account any masked
   regions from the associated weights images.
 * The cleaning parameter Clean.psfwidth is exposed to the
   configuration file.
 * Bugs in associating the footprint information with the correct
   field have been fixed.
 * If the CASDA-upload script is used to prepare data for deposit, the
   scheduling block state is transitioned to PENDINGARCHIVE.



0.14.0-p1 (9 September 2016)
----------------------------

An update to the pipeline processing only:

 * Fixing a bug in the handling of multiple FIELDs within a
   measurement set. These are now correctly given their own directory
   for the processed data products.
 * The footprint parameters are now preferentially determined from the
   scheduling block parset (using the 'schedblock' command-line
   utility). If not present, the scripts fall back to using the config
   file inputs.
 * The metadata files (taken from mslist, schedblock and footprint.py)
   are re-used on subsequent runs of the pipeline, rather than
   re-running each of these tools.
 * The default bucketsize for the mssplit jobs has been increased to
   1MB, and made configurable by the user. The stripe count for the
   non-data directories has also been changed to 1.


0.14.0 (11 August 2016)
-----------------------

A major release, with several new features and improvements for both
the imaging software and the pipeline scripts.

A new imager in under test in this release, currently just called 
"imager" and it has the following features:

 * In continuum mode it allows a core to process more than one channel.
   This has a small cost in memory and a proportional increase in disk
   access. But allows the continuum imaging to proceed with a much smaller
   footprint on the cluster. This will allow simultaneous processing of all 
   beams in a coming release. 
 * Spectral line cubes can be made from measurement sets that are from different
   epochs. The epochs are imaged separately but merged into the same image for
   minor-cycle solving.
 * The output spectral line cubes can be in the barycentric frame. This is currently
   just nearest neighbour indexing. But the possibility of interpolation has not been
   designed out. 
 * The concept of "multiple writers" has been introduced to improve the disk access 
   pattern for the spectral line mode.  This breaks up the cube into frequency bands.  
   These can be recombined post-processing. 
 * If you really want to increase the performance for many major cycles you can
   also turn on a shared memory option which stores visibility sets in memory throughout 
   processing.
 * The imager takes the same parset as Cimager - but extra key-value pairs are required to implement
   the features. 

This new imager is still under test and we have not added the hooks into the pipeline yet. 

Other updates to the imaging code include:
 * Simager is now more robust against completely-flagged
   channels - such channels will now be set to zero in the output
   cube, instead of failing the simager job.
 * The extraction of spectra done by Selavy is now more robust and
   better able to handle multiple components and distributed
   processing.
 * Selavy now accepts a reference direction when providing a
   components parset - the l & m coordinates are calculated relative
   to this, rather than the image centre.
 * The restore solver can now accept its own preconditioner
   parameters, in addition to the general parameters used by the
   other solvers. If specified, a second set of restored images
   will be written with suffix ".alt.restored".

The pipeline scripts have seen the following updates:
 * There is a new option to have a different image centre for each
   beam, rather than a common pixel grid for all images. This uses the
   beam centre location taken from the footprint.py utility (an
   external task in the ACES subversion area).
 * The self-calibration can now use cmodel to generate a model image,
   instead of using a components parset.
 * There are new tasks to:
   - Apply the gains calibration to the averaged measurement set
   - Image the averaged measurement set as "continuum cubes", in
     multiple polarisations
   - Apply an image-based continuum-subtraction following the creation
     of the spectral-line cubes. This makes use of an ACES python
     script to fit a low-order polynomial to each spectrum in the
     cube.
  * The headers of the FITS files created by the pipelines now have a
    wider range of metadata, including observatory and date-obs
    keywords, as well as information about the askapsoft & pipeline
    versions.
  * The restore preconditioner options mentioned above are available
    through RESTORE_PRECONDITIONER_ parameters, for the continuum
    imaging only (it is not implemented for simager).
  * Several bugs were fixed:
    - The continuum subtraction was failing when using components if
      no sources were found - it now skips the continuum subtraction
      step.
    - The askapdata module was, in certain situations, not loaded
      correctly, leading to somewhat cryptic errors in the imaging.
    - The parsing of mslist to obtain MS metadata would sometimes
      fail, depending on the content of the MS. It is now much more
      robust.
    - The default for TILENCHAN_SL has been increased to 10, to
      counter issues with mssplit running slow.


0.13.2 (19 July 2016)
---------------------

This bug-fix version addresses a few issues with the imaging &
source-finding code, along with minor updates to the pipeline
scripts.
The following bugs have been fixed in the processing software:
 * Caching of the Wiener preconditioner is now done, so that the
   weights are only calculated once for all solvers and the filters
   are only calculated once for all major cycles, scales &
   Taylor-terms. This has the effect of greatly speeding up the
   imaging, particularly for large image sizes.
 * The BasisfunctionMFS solver has had the additional convolution with
   the PSF removed. This fixes a bug where central sources were being
   cleaned preferentially to sources near the edge of the image.
   It also improves the resolution and SNR of minor-cycle dirty images.
 * From the update to casacore-2 in 0.13.0, linmos would fail when
   mosaicking images without restoring beams. This has been fixed (and
   behaves as it did prior to 0.13.0).
 * The size check in Selavy that rejects very large fitted components
   has been re-instated. This should allow the rejection of spurious
   large fitted components. The minimum size requirement (which forced
   sizes to be >60% of the PSF) has been removed.

And the pipeline has seen these fixes:
 * The resolution of the input science measurement set, when not given
   explicitly in the config file, is now done properly in all cases,
   rather than just for the case of splitting & flagging.
 * The pipeline now allows clipping in the snapshot option of the
   gridding - this improves performance at high declinations, where
   different warping between snapshots could introduce sharp edges to
   the weights image.
 * The pipeline also allows the use of a weights cutoff in the Selavy
   job used in self-calibration, to avoid the presence of these sharp
   cutoffs seen at high declinations.


0.13.1 (24 June 2016)
---------------------

This bug-fix version primarily addresses issues with the processing
pipelines. The following bugs have been fixed:
 * Non-integer image cell sizes were not being interpreted
   correctly. These values can now be any decimal value.
 * A change in the mslist output format with casacore v2 meant that
   the Cmodel continuum subtraction script was not reading the correct
   reference frequency. This caused the cmodel job to fail for the
   case of nterms>1. The parsing code has been fixed.
 * The archiving scripts had a few changes:
   - The resolution of filenames & paths has been fixed.
   - The source-finding is now run on FITS versions of the images
   - The catalogue keys in the observation.xml are now internally
     consistent.
   - The way thumbnail sizes are specified in the pipeline
     configuration file has changed slightly. 

Related to the above changes, the C++ code has had a couple of
changes:
 * casdaupload now correctly puts the thumbnail information in the
 <image> group in the observation.xml file.
 * Fixes were made to the Selavy VOTable output to fix formatting
 errors that were preventing it passing validation upon CASDA ingest.

Other C++ code changes include:
 * Fixes to the output files from the crossmatch utility.
 * Updates to the slice interfaces for compatibility with the TOS.

The documentation has also been updated, with updated descriptions of
parameters that have changed as a result of the above, a few typos
fixed, and new information about the management of data on Pawsey's
scratch2 filesystem. 

0.13.0 (31 May 2016)
--------------------

This version fixes a few issues with the processing pipelines, fixes
some bugs with the source-finder and casda upload utility, and moves
the underlying code to use version 2 of the casacore package.

The pipeline scripts have seen the following changes:
 * The requested times for the slurm jobs are now individually
 configurable via parameters in the processBETA config file.
 * The Pawsey account can be explicitly given, allowing the use of the
 scripts under other accounts on magnus.
 * The linmos job now properly checks the CLOBBER parameter, and will
 avoid over-writing mosaicked images if CLOBBER=false.
 * There is now an archiving option to the pipeline, which includes:
   - conversion of images to FITS format
   - creation of PNG 'thumbnail' versions of the 2D images
   - staging of data to a directory for ingest into CASDA

The processing software had the following changes:
 * The casacore package has been updated to version 2.0.3, with
 corresponding changes throughout the ASKAPsoft code tree.
 * NOTE that this has resulted in the code not building on OS X
 Mavericks (10.9).
 * The Selavy sourcefinder had two changes:
   - Errors on the fitted parameters are now reported in the component
   catalogue.
   - A bug that stopped Selavy running the variable-threshold option
   when the SNR image name was not specified has been fixed.
 * The casdaupload utility now requires the observation start and end
 times to be specified if no measurement set is provided.


0.12.2 (24 May 2016)
--------------------

A bug fix release for the processing pipeline.
This fixes a problem where the mosaicking task was still assuming beam
IDs that had a single integer - ie. it was looking for
image.beam0.restored instead of image.beam00.restored.


0.12.1 (18 May 2016)
--------------------

This is a simple patch release that fixes a couple of bugs, one of
which affected the performance of both the source-finder and the
pipelines.

The measurement of spectral indices for fitted components to continuum
Taylor-term images was being done incorrectly, leading to erroneous
values for spectral-index and spectral-curvature. This, in turn, could
lead to inaccuracies or even failures in the continuum-subtraction
task of the pipeline (when the CONTSUB_METHOD=Cmodel option was used).
This only affected version 0.12.0 (released on 8 May 2016), and is
fully corrected in 0.12.1.

The other bug enforces the total number of channels processed by the
pipelines to be an exact multiple of the averaging width
(NUM_CHAN_TO_AVERAGE). In previous versions, the pipeline scripts
would press on, but this would potentially result in errors in the
slurm files and jobs not executing. Now, should NUM_CHAN_TO_AVERAGE
not divide evenly into the number of channels requested, the script
will exit with an error message before submitting any jobs.

0.12.0 (8 May 2016)
-------------------

This version has a number of changes to the processing applications
and the pipeline scripts.

Bugs that have been fixed in the processing applications include:
* The deconvolution major cycles were using out-of-date residual
 values when logging and testing against the threshold.majorcycle
 parameter. This is now fixed.  
* The initialisation of calibrator input now depends more closely on
the input parameters nAnt, nBeam & the calibrator model, rather than
the first chunk of the data - this allows the shape of the data cube
to change throughout the dataset (which will help with data imported
from MIRIAD/CASA). 
* Simager was showing a cross-shaped artefact when Wiener
preconditioning was used, even with the preservecf parameter set to
true. This parameter is now recognised, and the artefact is no longer
seen. 
* Full polarisation handling is now possible with simager (in the same
manner as for cimager). 
* Simager was crashing when no preconditioner was given - this has
been fixed. 
* The casdaupload task now conforms to the current CASDA requirements
of allowing multiple SBIDs, and of reporting the image type. 
* Selavy's Gaussian fitting is now more able to fit confused
components that are not immediately identified from the initial
estimates. 
* Selavy was also failing when given images of a particular name
(short, without a full-stop). This has been fixed. 

The pipeline scripts have had a number of improvements:
* They are more robust for processing ADE data, with >9 beams and >6
antennas. 
* The flagging tasks have been improved, with:
 - Flagging of autocorrelations an option
 - The selection flagger (that does antenna-based & autocorrelations)
 is done first, along with (an optional) flat amplitude threshold. 
 - The dynamic flagging is done as the second pass
 - There is more user control over these individual elements
* New parameters are available in the scripts, to make use of the
snapshotimaging.longtrack parameter in the gridding, and
normalisegains option in the self-calibration. The latter improves the
performance of the self-calibration, approximating phase-only
self-calibration. 
* The slurm jobfiles are now more robust to the user's environment -
if the askapsoft module has not been loaded, it will be in the
jobfile, and the user can request a different version. 


0.11.2 (28 March 2016)
----------------------

This release is a relatively small bug-fix update, primarily fixing a
bug in cimager.

This bug would prevent a parallel job completing in the case of the
major cycle threshold being reached prior to the requested maximum
number of major cycles.

Other changes include:
* The pipeline scripts have a few minor fixes to the code to improve
reliability, and ensure the correct number of cores used for jobs is
reported in the statistics files. 
* The only change to the ingest pipeline (within askapservices)
incorporates an extra half-cycle wait following fringe-rotator
update. 


0.11.1 (8 March 2016)
---------------------

The imaging software now incorporates the preservecf option (released
in 0.11.0) into the SphFunc gridder, and introduces a new option to
the gridding - snapshotimaging.longtrack - that predicts the best fit
W plane used for the snapshot imaging, finding the plane that
minimises the future deviation in W. This can have substantial savings
in processing time for long tracks. 

The pipeline scripts have seen a number of minor improvements and
fixes, with improved alternative methods for continuum subtraction,
and improved reporting of resource usage (including a record of the
number of cores used for each job). The user configuration file is now
also copied to a timestamped version for future reference. 

The ingest pipeline code has incorporated changes resulting from the
recent commissioning activities. 


0.11.0 (15 February 2016)
-------------------------

A key change made in the processing software relates the
preconditioning. There is a new parameter preconditioning.preservecf
that should be set to true for the case of using WProject and the
Wiener preconditioner. This has fixed a couple of issues - at low
(negative) robustness values, the cross-shaped artefact that was
sometimes seen has now gone, and the performance should now more
closely match that expected from robust weighting for the full range
of robustness values. 

Several other bugs were fixed:
* Linmos had a bug (that was introduced in version 0.10) where
automatically-generated primary beams were being set to the position
of the first image.  
* The multiscale-MFS solver had a small bug that would lead to
higher-order terms being preconditioned multiple times 
* Cmodel had bugs related to the reading of Selavy catalogues, and
correctly representing deconvolved Gaussians. It now works correctly
with such data 
* Simager would fail were no preconditioners supplied.
* Selavy now better handles images that do not have spectral axes (an
issue when dealing with images made by packages other than
ASKAPsoft). 

Additionally, the regridding has been sped up through a patch to the
casacore library. 

The pipeline scripts also have a new feature, making use of Selavy +
Cmodel to better perform the continuum subtraction from spectral-line
data. The old approach is still available, but is not the default. 


0.10.1 (18 January 2016)
------------------------

Much of this release relates to updates to the ingest pipeline and
related tasks, in preparation for getting it running at Pawsey. These
are now deployed as their own module, although it is not expected that
ACES members will need to use this. 

In the science processing area, an important fix was made to the code
responsible for uvw rotations. A fault was identified where these were
being projected into the wrong frame, which could lead to positional
offsets in images made away from the initial phase centre. This fault
has been fixed. 

Some initial fixes to the preconditioner have been made that may
improve images when Wiener filtering with a low or negative robustness
parameter. Improvements are only expected when snapshot imaging is not
being used. A full fix is being tested and is planned for the next
release. 

This release also sees the BETA pipeline scripts move into an
askapsoft-derived module (although this had previously been
announced). 


0.9.0 (12 October 2015)
-----------------------

There are only a small number of changes to the core processing part
of the software that would affect ACES work on galaxy, and these are
almost all to do with the source-finder Selavy. The default values of
some parameters governing output files have changed, with the
preference now to minimise the number of output files. A few
corrections have been made to the units of parameters in some of the
output catalogues. 


0.8.1 (10 September 2015)
-------------------------

This release introduces simager, the prototype spectral-line imager -
this allows imaging of large spectral cubes through distributed
processing, and is capable of creating much larger cubes than
cimager. While this is not the final version of the spectral-line
imager - the software framework that underpins the imaging code is
going through a re-design prior to early science - it does demonstrate
the distributed-processing approach that enables large numbers of
spectral channels to be processed. 

For those wanting to make use of the ACES scripts under subversion,
these will be updated shortly to include use of simager. 

Other changes to the askapsoft module include minor updates to the
CASDA HI catalogue interface from the Selavy sourcefinder, and
ADE-related updates to the ingest pipeline and associated tools (which
won’t affect work on galaxy). 


0.7.3 (21 August 2015)
----------------------

This release has a few relatively small bug fixes that have been
resolved in the past week: 
* a minor fix to cimager that solves a rare problem with the
visibility metadata statistics calculations, that would result in
cimager failing (this had been seen in processing the basic continuum
tutorial data). 
* correcting the shape (BMAJ/BMIN/BPA) parameters in the
Selavy-generated component parset output (that might be used as input
to ccalibrator in self-calibration) - they were previously given in
arcsec/degrees rather than radians (as required by
ccalibrator/csimulator). 
* aligning the cmodel VOTable inputs with the new Selavy output
formats 
* a fix to the units in one of the Selavy VOTable outputs 


0.7.2 (9 August 2015)
---------------------

This release is a bug-fix release aimed at fixing a problem identified
in running the basic continuum imaging tutorial. There was an issue
with the way the simulated data had been created, which meant that
mssplit would fail on those measurement sets. This has been fixed
(fixing both mssplit and msmerge), and the tutorial dataset and
description have been updated. 

If you use mssplit on real BETA data, you will not notice any
difference, save for potentially a small performance improvement. 

The only other change has been implementation of the CASDA format for
absorption-line catalogues, although the implementation of actual
absorption-line searching is not complete in Selavy, so this will
probably not affect any of you (it has been more to provide early
examples for use by the CASDA team). 


0.7.0 (3 July 2015)
