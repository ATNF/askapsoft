Post-processing of detections
=============================

Once the list of detected objects has been obtained, there are several
post-processing steps that can be utilised. We describe here mask
optimisation, two-dimensional component fitting, and spectral index &
curvature measurement.


Mask optimisation
-----------------

The WALLABY team have provided an algorithm to optimise the source
mask (equivalent to the Duchamp concept of growing detections), such
that the integrated flux of the detection is maximised subject to the
noise present. This has been provided to avoid issues with the fact
that the Duchamp-based parameterisation makes use only of the detected
pixels, so structure below the detection threshold is not taken into
account. Growing the object in this way increases the number of faint
pixels contributing to source parameterisation.
 
Unlike the Duchamp-derived "growing" algorithm
(**Selavy.flagGrowth=true**), the growing process does not use a flux
or signal-to-noise threshold. Rather, it adds elliptical annuli to the
source until the total flux of the *annulus* is negative or a
specified maximum number of iterations is reached. It does this for
all channels within Â±W50 of the central spectral channel.

Algorithm details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The algorithm is implemented in the following way:

1. Source detection is performed using the usual Duchamp/Selavy
   approaches. Note that the growing option can be used prior to the
   mask optimisation.
2. First step for a given object is to define the spectral range over
   which the optimisation is done. This is taken to be W50 either side
   of the centre of the detection (in turn, defined by the Duchamp
   parameter pixelCentre). All channels within this range are treated
   equally.
3. An ellipse is then fitted to the moment-0 map of the object. The
   moment-0 map uses the detected voxels only, so is dependent on the
   source-detection done prior to the mask optimisation.
4. If **clobberPrevious=true**, the source is pared back to the single
   pixel at the centre, which is used as the seed for the
   optimisation. Otherwise, we keep the existing mask and build on it.
5. The mask is then grown:

 i. For each spatial pixel in the current mask, all neighbouring
    pixels not already in the mask that lie within the ellipse are
    included in a new object. This is done for every channel over the
    spectral range
 ii. If the flux of this object is positive, each of its pixels are
     added to the current mask,
 iii. The size of the ellipse is increased by 1 pixel in the major
      axis direction, and enough in the minor axis direction to
      preserve the shape.

6. This continues as long as the flux of the new "object" is positive,
   and the number of growing iterations is less than **maxIter**.
7. The parameterisation of the object is redone.
8. Once all objects have been done, the Duchamp merging process is
   re-run to cleanup any pairs of objects that may have intersected.

Note that the flux etc that is calculated for the object after the
mask optimisation replaces the value that would have been calculated
before it. At this point, if you want to know, say, the integrated
flux of an object with and without this mask optimisation, you will
need to run the algorithm twice. I am looking at providing this as an
*alternative* flux measurement - at that point the code may be put
into the Duchamp library proper, rather than just in Selavy.

The result of the mask optimisation does depend somewhat on what is
done in the source-detection prior to its use. Using the growing
method of Duchamp (**flagGrowth=true** and **growthCut** or
**growthThreshold**) allows a good initial estimate of both the
spectral range and the ellipse fitted to the moment-0 map. The
optimised mask still tends to be larger than that from Duchamp-growing
alone (at least from the limited testing done so far).

To aid evaluation of this algorithm, the mask FITS output of Duchamp
has been enabled in Selavy, although *only for the serial case*. If
running a multiple-node job, the mask will not be written. When
written, the mask will be called *selavy-MASK-IMG.fits*, where the IMG
refers to the input image.

Source fitting
--------------

For continuum images, we have implemented the ability to fit 2D
Gaussian components to detected sources. Note that no such facility
yet exists for 3D cubes. For the purposes of this section, we adopt
the terminology used elsewhere of describing the detected objects
(that is, collections of pixels above the detection threshold) as
'islands' which have 'components' fitted to them. For Selavy, the
islands are the result of running the detection algorithms, and it is
the islands that are written to the catalogue given by
**Selavy.outFile** (defaulting to *selavy-results.txt*).

Setup
~~~~~

The fitting itself is done by the *fitGaussian* function from the
*casacore* package. This returns a set of parameters for each
Gaussian: peak flux, x-pixel centre, y-pixel centre, major axis FWHM,
axial ratio, position angle.

The pixels that are used in the fit are chosen in one of two ways. If
**Selavy.Fitter.fitJustDetection=true**, then only the island pixels
(ie. those that were detected) are used in the fit - no "background"
pixels are used. This avoid confusion with possible neighbouring
sources.

Alternatively, if **Selavy.Fitter.fitJustDetection=false**, the
fitting is done using all pixels in a box surrounding the island. This
box is defined by padding a border of a minimum number of pixels
(defined by the **boxPadSize** parameter) in all directions around the
island pixels (moving out from the extremities of the detected
pixels). Only the pixels lying within this box are used in the
fit. This approach is more consistent with the approach used in the
FIRST survey.

Note that all parameters governing the fitting require a
**Selavy.Fitter.** prefix, but for convenience this is left out in the
text that follows.

Noise determination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The noise level (ie. the standard deviation of the noise background)
is used by the fitting function to weight the fitting function and
obtain the chi-squared value. This noise level is not that used by the
detection algorithm, but rather one obtained by finding the median
absolute deviation from the median (MADFM) in a square box centred on
the island's peak pixel. The side length of the box is governed by the
**noiseBoxSize** parameter, which defaults to 101 pixels. Note that it
is different to the box mentioned above. The MADFM is converted to an
equivalent rms for a Gaussian noise distribution (by dividing by
0.674888).

It is possible to do the fit without calculating the noise level, by
seeting **useNoise = false**. This sets the pixel sigma value to 1 for
each pixel, effectively removing the noise from the chi-squared
calculation.



Initial estimation of parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *fitGaussian* function requires an initial estimate of the
parameters. There are two ways Selavy obtains this initial
estimate. The first way (the default) uses the following recursive
algorithm to provide a list of sub-components (being distinct peaks
within an island):

* Using the island pixels, define a set of parameters: peak flux and
  location are obvious, while the major & minor axes & position angle
  are obtained from Duchamp algorithms, using a separate detection
  process at half the peak flux (to get the full width at half
  maximum).
* Define a set of sub-thresholds (the number of these is given by the
  **numSubThresholds** parameter) spaced either linearly or
  logarithmically between the peak flux and the detection threshold
  (the separation between sub-thresholds is constant in either log or
  linear space depending on whether the input parameter
  **logarithmicThresholds** is true or false).
* For each threshold, search the box surrounding the object, and
  record the number of separate detections.

 - If there is more than one separate object, call the
   getSubComponentList function on each of these and add the result to
   the vector list.

* When you reach the final threshold, add the initial set of
  parameters to the vector list and return the vector list.

The second approach attempts to replicate the algorithm described in
`Hancock et al. (2012), MNRAS 422, 1812`_ (which is used in Paul's
'Aegean' source-finder). This creates a curvature map using a discrete
2D Laplacian kernel. The curvature map, in combination with the mask
of detected pixels, is used to locate local maxima within the
island. The image is convolved with the 3x3 kernel - note that this
means the single row of pixels around the edge will not have a
curvature value assigned.

 .. _Hancock et al. (2012), MNRAS 422, 1812: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.422.1812H
 
A point source is placed at each local maxima to provide the initial
estimate of components. To use this mode, set
**useCurvature=true**. The curvature map can be saved to a CASA image
by setting the **curvatureImage** parameter.

If the Gaussian fitting fails to provide a good fit, these initial
estimates can be returned as the results, with a flag indicating they
are only estimates. Whether this is done is governed by the parameter
**useGuessIfBad**, which defaults to **true**. If an estimate is
reported in the results output, the final column *Guess?* will take
the value 1, else it will be 0.


Fitting
~~~~~~~

If **numGaussFromGuess=true** (the default), the number of Gaussians
that are fitted to the island is exactly equal to the number of
subcomponents in the initial estimate. If, however,
**numGaussFromGuess=false**, then the number of Gaussians fitted is
between 1 and **maxNumGauss**. The subcomponents are chosen as initial
estimates in order of their peak flux. If there are more Gaussians
needed than there are subcomponents, we simply cycle through the list.

The fitting is done by casacore's *fitGaussian* function. The fit is
repeated a further two times, each time using the output of the
previous fit as the initial guess. This results in a slight refinement
of the fit, usually (but not always!) improving the chi-squared value.

The parameters that are fitted to the data are defined by the
**fitType** parameter. This can take one of the following values:

* *full*: All six parameters of the Gaussian are free to be fitted to
  the data.
* *psf*: Only the position and height of the Gaussian are fitted. The
  size & shape are fixed to match the beam size, taken from the image
  header (or the beamSize parameter if the image header does not have
  the beam information).
* *shape*: Only the position and shape of the Gaussian are fitted. The
  height is fixed to match the peak pixel flux of the object.
* *height*: Only the height of the Gaussian is fitted, with the
  location and shape kept constant.

All types can be given in vector format to the **fitType**
parameter. In this case, all listed types of fits are done, and the
best result (judged by the reduced chi-squared value) is chosen as the
best fit. This means that if the best fit for the "full" case is a
beam-sized Gaussian, the fit from the "psf" case will be chosen as it
has more degrees of freedom and so a lower reduced chi-squared.

When **numGaussFromGuess=true** and the fit converges but is poor, we
test to see if an additional, confused component is present (that was
not picked up by the original initial estimate). The fitted Gaussian
is subtracted from the pixels, then the initial estimation algorithm
is re-run. The brightest component found is added to the initial
estimates provided to the fitting routine, and the fit is re-run with
one extra Gaussian. This process continues until the fit does not
converge. 


Accepting the fit
.................

The fit is accepted according to a list of criteria, that follow those
used in the FIRST survey (`Becker, White & Helfand 1995`_). These are:

* The fit must have converged.
* The chi-squared value is examined in one of two ways. The second
  method is used provided the **chisqConfidence** parameter is between
  0 and 1. Otherwise (the default case), the first method is used.

 - The reduced chi-squared is compared to the **maxReducedChisq**
   parameter, and accepted if smaller. (Here we define ``rchisq =
   chisq / (npix - numGauss*nfree - 1)``, where *nfree* is the number
   of free parameters : *See below for discussion*)
 - The chi-squared value and the number of degrees of freedom are used
   to calculate the probability of a chi-squared-distributed parameter
   having the given value or less, and compared to the
   **chisqConfidence** level. For numbers of degrees of freedom
   greater than 343, computational requirements mean this is
   approximated by requiring the reduced chi-squared to be less than
   1.2.

* The centre of each component must be inside the box
* The separation between any pair of components must be more than 2
  pixels
* The flux of each component must be positive and more than half the
  detection threshold
* No component's peak flux can exceed twice the highest pixel in the
  box.
* The sum of the integrated fluxes of all components must not be more
  than twice the total flux in the box.

The results of each of these tests is printed to the log as a 1 (pass)
or a 0 (fail).

If **numGaussFromGuess=true**, then we only use the same number of
Gaussians as the number of components in the initial estimate. If this
is **false**, the the behaviour is governed by the
**stopAfterFirstGoodFit** parameter. If
**stopAfterFirstGoodFit=true**, once the first acceptable fit is found
(starting with a single Gaussian), the fitting is stopped. Multiple
Gaussians are fitted only if fewer Gaussians do not give an acceptable
fit. If **stopAfterFirstGoodFit=false** then the fitting using one
through to the maximum number of Gaussians, and the best fit is chosen
to be the one that passes all the above criteria and has the lowest
reduced chi-squared value.

Given the above, however, Selavy will react to fits that are
unacceptable in the following way:

* If the fit fails to converge, and there was more than one Gaussian
  being fitted, then Selavy will try again with one fewer Gaussian
  (unless it has already tried that number).
* If the fit converges, but has a high chi-squared value, Selavy will
  remove the fitted components and search for any further components
  that may have been missed with the initial search. The brightest of
  any found is added to the list of initial estimates, and the fit is
  re-done. This process can recover additional components that do not
  stand out as separate peaks when all components are present.

.. _Becker, White & Helfand 1995: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995ApJ...450..559B

A note on the reduced chi-squared
.................................

The expression used to calculate the reduced chi-squared as shown
above is fine if the pixels are independent. However, this is not the
case for radio data, where neighbouring pixels are correlated due to
the finite beam size. It is not immediately obvious what the correct
way to estimate the reduced chi-squared is. It may be that, formally,
a different metric should be used in assessing the goodness-of-fit
(since an underlying assumption of the chi-squared test is that the
pixels are independent).

Note that, leaving aside the formal requirements of the statistical
test, this is primarily a problem when comparing different successful
fits that have different numbers of Gaussians. The determination of
the best fit for a given number of Gaussians should not be affected
(although the second of our acceptance criteria might have to change).

Output files
............

Several files are produced to show the results of the Gaussian
fitting. The first is a CASDA-compliant components catalogue. In
pipeline operation, this would be the catalogue sent to CASDA, the
CSIRO ASKAP Science Data Archive. This takes its name
from the **Selavy.resultsFile** parameter, replacing the *.txt*
extension with *.components.txt*. An XML/VOTable version is also
produced (always), with a *.xml* extension. An example of the text
version of this catalogue is shown here:

The columns are:

* *island_ID* and *component_ID* are the unique identifiers of the
  component, and the island from which it comes. These are of the form
  "SB<SBID>_island_<NUM>" and "SB<SBID>_component_<NUM><CMP>", where
  <SBID> is the numerical scheduling block ID provided by
  ``Selavy.sbid``, <NUM> is the island numerical identifier, and <CMP>
  is one or more characters indicating the order of components for
  that island. These will be a-z for the first 26, then aa-zz, then
  aaa-zzz and so forth. If no scheduling block ID is provided, the
  "SB<SBID>\_" prefix will be omitted.
* The position is indicated by the *component_name* (J2000 IAU
  format), as well as HMS/DMS-format strings and decimal degree values
  for both RA and DEC. Errors in the position will also be given in
  time (not yet implemented fully).
* *freq* shows the frequency of the image.
* The peak and integrated fluxes are shown, with their errors.
* The size and orientation of the fitted Gaussian is shown by the
  major and minor axes (FWHM) and the position angle of the major
  axis. This is shown for the fitted values (*maj_axis* et al), their
  errors (*maj_axis_err* et al), and their deconvolved values given
  the image's restoring beam (*maj_axis_deconv* et al) along with errors. 
* The quality of the fit is shown by *chi_squared_fit* and
  *rms_fit_gauss*.
* The fitted spectral index and spectral curvature are shown when
  calculated. This is only done when the appropriate flags are set -
  see `Spectral Terms`_. Errors are given for these as well.
* *rms_image* shows the measurement of the local noise.
* Several flags are reported:
  
  * *has_siblings* is true if the component is one of many fitted to the same island
  * *fit_is_estimate* is true if the fit failed for some reason - the
    reported values for the component parameters come from the initial
    estimate
  * *spectral_index_from_TT* shows that the spectral index & curvature
    were calculated from Taylor-term images (if *true*) or the
    continuum cube (if *false*). 
  * The as-yet unnamed *flag_c4* indicates that the fitted component is
    formally bad - it doesn't meet the chi-squared criterion, but is
    the best fit possible.

Along with the components catalogue, a matching Karma/CASA/DS9
annotation (region) file will be produced showing the location & size
of the components (each Gaussian component is indicated by an ellipse
given by the major & minor axes and position angle of the
component). These are named in the same way as the catalogue file,
but with a .ann/.crf/.reg extension respectively. Whether these are
produced is governed by the flagKarma/flagCasa/flagDS9 parameters (see
:doc:`selavy` for details).

By setting **Fitter.writeComponentMap=true** (the default), an image
is made showing just the fitted Gaussian components. This is the
"component map". At the same time, a residual map (input image with
the component map subtracted) is created. These default to being FITS
files, unless **Fitter.imagetype=casa** is given. If *imagename* is
the input image given to Selavy, the name of these images will be
componentMap_*imagename*.fits and componentResidual_*imagename*.fits
(with no ".fits" extension for casa images),

A similar output file is the fit Results catalogue. This is only
produced when **writeFitResults=true**. This shows the fit results
with a different emphasis (this is the original method of showing the
fit results in Selavy). This too takes its name from the
**Selavy.resultsFile** parameter, replacing the *.txt* extension with
*.fitResults.txt*. An example start for the file is as follows below.

The columns provided are:

* *ID* is a unique ID for the component. It comprises the ID number of
  the island, plus one or more characters indicating the order of
  components for that island. These will be a-z for the first 26, then
  aa-zz, then aaa-zzz and so forth.
* *Name* is the name taken from the island.
* *RA*, *Dec*, *X* and *Y* are the world and pixel locations of the
  *component*.
* *F_int* and *F_peak* are values for the island as calculated by the
  Duchamp code, and reported in the Duchamp results file given by
  **Selavy.outFile**. These are the same for each comonent of that
  island.
* *F_int(fit)* and *F_pk(fit)* are the integrated & peak fluxes from
  the fitted Gaussians.
* Alpha and Beta are the spectral index and spectral curvature terms
  (with associated errors). These are only provided when the
  appropriate flags are set - see `Spectral Terms`_.
* *Maj*, *Min* and *P.A.* are the major and minor FWHMs and the
  position angle of the fitted Gaussian, quoted for both the fit and
  the fit deconvolved by the beam, with errors for each version.
* The goodness of fit is indicated by the *Chisq(fit)* and *RMS(fit)*
  values, while *RMS(image)* gives the local noise surrounding the
  object.
* *Nfree(fit)* is the number of free parameters in the fit, and
  *NDoF(fit)* is the number of degrees of freedom.
* *Npix(fit)* is the number of pixels used in doing the fit, and
  *Npix(obj)* is the number of pixels in the object itself
  (ie. detected pixels).
* A value of 1 in the *fit_is_estimate* column indicates that the "fitted"
  parameters come from the initial estimate (the fitting procedure
  failed for some reason). 

If no fit was made (see components 1a and 1b in the example above),
the Gaussian parameters are taken from the initial estimate, while
those parameters relating to the quality of the fit are set to zero
(for RMS, Nfree etc) or 999 (chisq).

A VOTable version of the fit results is also produced, with a *.xml*
suffix. This is always produced whenever the fit results file is
produced.

As well as the "best" fit catalogue, a catalogue of fit results is
written for each fitType considered (out of 'full','psf','shape' and
'height'). These will be named, for instance,
*selavy-results.fitResults.full.txt*. 

Two types of annotation files will also be produced:

* Fitted components - a Karma/CASA/DS9 annotation (region) file showing
  the fitting results (each Gaussian component is indicated by an
  ellipse given by the major & minor axes and position angle of the
  component). These are named in the same way as the fit results file,
  but with a .ann/.crf/.reg extension respectively. Whether these are
  produced is governed by the flagKarma/flagCasa/flagDS9 parameters
  (see :doc:`selavy` for details).
* **fitBoxAnnotationFile** [selavy-fitResults.boxes.ann] - an
  annotation file showing the boxes used for the Gaussian fitting (if
  boxes were not used, ie. **fitJustDetection=true**, this file is not
  created). 

The user can request that a component parset be created,
showing the fitted components. Such a file could be used in tasks such
as :doc:`../calim/ccalibrator`, for self-calibration, or
:doc:`../calim/csimulator`. This file is created by providing a
filename with the **Selavy.outputComponentParset** parameter. By
default, all components are written, but you can specify a maximum
number to be included using the
**Selavy.outputComponentParset.maxNumComponents** parameter (the list
is ordered by flux, so that the brightest ones are written first). The
shape of the components is included by default, but you can force them
to be point sources by setting
**Selavy.outputComponentParset.reportSize=false**. See
:doc:`../calim/csimulator` for details on how components should be
specified.

Additionally, images showing the fitted Gaussians and the residual map
after subtracting these Gaussians from the input image are always
created when *doFit=true*. These will be named to match the input
image: the map of fitted Gaussians will have **componentMap_** prepended
to the image name, and the residual map will have **componentResidual_**
prepended.

Spectral Index & Curvature
--------------------------

Measuring spectral terms from Taylor-term images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Selavy is designed to work in conjunction with the ASKAPsoft
pipeline. For continuum data, a common processing mode will be
multi-frequency synthesis, where the output will be a series of
"Taylor-term" images, being the coefficients of a Taylor-expansion of
the frequency spectrum at each pixel. The equations governing this
expansion are indicated here

.. image:: spectralEquations.png
   :width: 80%
   :align: center

Equation 1 and 2 show the assumed spectral shape (in linear and log
space respectively), while Equation 3 shows the Taylor expansion about
the reference frequency (nu_0) for 3 terms. The coefficients of these
terms are the quantities in the Taylor-term images: taylor 0 -
a total intensity (I) image (at a fiducial frequency); taylor 1 - the
alpha * I map, where alpha is the spectral index; taylor 2 - I *
(beta + 0.5*alpha*(alpha-1)), where beta is the spectral curvature.

We want to extract a value for alpha & beta for each component. We do
this by fitting to the total intensity image, as described above. Each
resulting component is then fitted to the taylor 1 & 2 images, keeping
the shape and location constant. This just fits the normalisation of
the Gaussian. The total flux of the Gaussian is then extracted and
used in the above relations.

The measurement of the spectral information in this way is dependent
on the fitting, so one needs to request Gaussian fitting via the above
parameters. The measurement of spectral index and spectral curvature
can be requested independently (if, for instance, you have only a
spectral index map).
 
Selavy defaults to assuming the images have been produced in the
ASKAPsoft pipeline, and are thus named in a specific way. It is
possible, however, to specify alternative names for the spectral index
& curvature images (ie. Taylor 1 & 2 maps), although the data they
hold must be formed in the same way (ie. conform to the above
relationships). The image names are specified via the
**spectralTermImages** input parameter. If this is not given, the
names are derived, if possible, from the image name, assuming a
standard format: if the total intensity image is named
XXX.taylor.0.YYY, then the spectral index map will be XXX.taylor.1.YYY
and the spectral curvature map will be XXX.taylor.2.YYY.

If the additional Taylor maps are not available, or the
**findSpectralTerms** parameters are set to **false**, then the values
for spectral-index and spectral-curvature will be set to the special
value of -99.

Measuring spectral terms from a continuum cube
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Selavy provides an alternative method for obtaining the spectral
terms. If a continuum cube is available (that is, a cube that
preserves the individual channels, rather than collapsing them to form
the Taylor images), then spectra can be extracted from it and the
spectral terms determined via fitting.

Each component has its spectrum extracted in the same manner as for
the Rotation Measure Synthesis (see below, and on :doc:`extraction`).
This spectrum is then fitted, using a non-linear Levenberg-Marquardt
algorithm, with the function given by Equation 1 above. The user can
select how many terms to fit - the default is 3, so that I_0, alpha
and beta will be fit, but this can be set to 1 or 2 instead.

The user can also impose a threshold S/N value on a
component-by-component basis, below which no fitting will be done.
This defaults to zero, however, meaning all components will have their
spectra fitted.

Rotation Measure Synthesis
--------------------------

Description of the algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Selavy can be used to perform Rotation Measure Synthesis on the
full-Stokes spectra of continuum components identified from a
continuum map. The procedure follows that specified by the POSSUM
survey science team, and can be described as follows:

 * A continuum component is found in a continuum image, and fitted
   with a 2D Gaussian (as described above).
 * Spectra are extracted from the corresponding location in Stokes I,
   Q, and U continuum cubes. The spectra are extracted from an NxN
   pixel box centred on the peak of the Gaussian (where N defaults to
   5, as per the POSSUM specification). See :doc:`extraction` for
   details on the method used.
 * The noise spectra in Q & U are extracted and averaged together to
   form the QU noise spectrum. This is used for weighting (if the "variance"
   weightType is selected). 
 * The Q and U spectra are normalised by a model spectrum of Stokes
   I - we use either the Taylor-term expansion from the Stokes-I
   imaging or a low-order polynomial fit. They are then used to
   generate a Faraday Dispersion function (FDF) as a function of
   lambda-squared. The FDF is then multiplied by the model I flux at
   the reference wavelength.
 * The location of the peak of the FDF is recorded as the rotation
   measure of the component, with the peak value of the FDF
   (multiplied again by the Stokes I model spectrum) giving the
   polarised intensity.
 * The peak is also fitted with a three-point quadratic function,
   yielding a better estimate of the peak (avoiding the sampling of
   the Faraday depth function).
 * These and other quantities are written to a polarisation catalogue,
   that is named in the same way as the component and island
   catalogues - see the description above.
 * The extracted spectra of I, Q & U can also be written out to
   individual files, along with the FDF and RMSF arrays. These files
   can be either CASA or FITS format, selectable via the
   **RMSynthesis.imagetype** parameter. Unlike elsewhere, this
   defaults to **fits**. The FDF and RMSF files can each be written as 
   either single complex-valued spectra, or separate spectra for the
   phase & amplitude. If FITS output is being used, the complex-valued
   option is not available.
