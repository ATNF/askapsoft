MergedSource  
============

MergedSource task is the main source task intended to be used in the production system. It is named
such because it merges visibility stream (received by VisSource) and metadata stream (received by 
MetadataSource) by aligning them using time. The user does not need to setup VisSource and MetadataSource
explicitly, they are instantiated inside this task. The metadata access requires appropriate *Ice*
configuration, see the main :doc:`index` page for details.

Configuration Parameters
------------------------

Ingest pipeline requires a configuration file be provided on the command line. This
section describes the valid parameters applicable to this particular task.
These parameters need to be defined only if this task is used. As for all tasks, parameters are taken
from keys with tasks.\ **name**\ .params prefix (not shown in the table below) where
**name** is an arbitrary name assigned to this task and used in *tasklist*\ .
The type of the task defined by tasks.\ **name**\ .type should be set to *MergedSource*.
