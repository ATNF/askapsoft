NoMetadataSource  
================

NoMetadataSource is a source task which does not depend on the metadata stream from the 
Telescope Operating System (TOS). It uses the same classes to receive visibility datagrams
and decode the content as the main :doc:`mergedsource` task, but takes additional information,
which is normally supplied via the metadata, from the configuration parameters. This is often handy for
debugging because one could have the ingest pipeline loosely coupled to the rest of the system, and,
therefore, being started and stopped manually at any time (as opposed to being started by TOS when
the observations start with the data ingest commencing only when the appropriate metadata are received).
As this task does not use the metadata stream at all, the metadata-specific  *Ice* configuration 
(see the main page on :doc:`index` for further details) is ignored. Note, the metadata supplied via the parset 
essentially lead to a static configuration with a single scan which cannot be changed without stopping
the ingest pipeline. This unlike :doc:`mergedsource`\ , which receives the same information via the
metadata and, therefore, can start new scans dynamically. Another consequence of this is inability
to stop based on the special **end of observation** flag in the metadata. If **NoMetadataSource** task
is used, the ingest pipeline has to be stopped via **Ctrl+C** or a signal.

Configuration Parameters
------------------------

Ingest pipeline requires a configuration file to be provided on the command line. This
section describes the valid parameters applicable to this particular task.
These parameters need to be defined only if this task is used. As for all tasks, parameters are taken
from keys with tasks.\ **name**\ .params prefix (not shown in the table below) where
**name** is an arbitrary name assigned to this task and used in *tasklist*\ .
The type of the task defined by tasks.\ **name**\ .type should be set to *NoMetadataSource*.
As mentioned above, this task is different from :doc:`mergedsource` in the way the information normally
supplied in the metadata stream is obtained. Therefore, all configuration parameters of the :doc:`mergedsource`
are understood by **NoMetadataSource**\ . The table below contains additional parameters understood by this
task which fill in for the metadata content. Note, *NoMetadataSource* requires beam arrangement parameters
to be defined in parset (see the section in :doc:`index`).
