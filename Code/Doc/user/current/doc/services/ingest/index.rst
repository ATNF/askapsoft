Ingest pipeline 
================

The *ingest pipeline* is the central component of the data acquision part
of the system. It is responsible for producing self-contained measurement sets
with the visibility data and appropriate metadata. Under normal circumstances,
the *ingest pipeline* is started by the *Central Processor Manager*. The latter
also has the ability to abort *ingest pipeline*. However, under typical operation
it does not "stop" the ingest pipeline, it stopes when the metadata flowing from
the Telescope Operating System's Executive component indicates an observation has
concluded. The *Executive* assembles configuration file for the *ingest pipeline*
based on the current observation and the *Facility Configuration Manager* 
hostiting the system configuration information which is not expected to change 
frequently from one observation to another.

Execution
---------

The *ingest pipeline* is a C++ application which can both with MPI and as a 
standalone program. Assuming the library path environment variable contains the 
required dependencies it can be started like so::

   <MPI wrapper>  cpingest -c cpingest.in -l cpingest.log_cfg 


Command Line Parameters

The CP manager accepts the following command line parameters:

|                   |                |             |is used.                                                        |

General overview
----------------

The *ingest pipeline* can be viewed as a collection of tasks executed on the data sequentially. The processing
always starts at the **Source** task, which is responsible for receiving data and for apppropriate formatting and 
tagging. The presence of a source task in the task chain is the requirement. However, the rest of the task chain
can in principle be empty (although in this case the ingest pipeline will not store or process the data, it will
only ingest it). The data writing task is called **MS Sink**. There is no requirement that the sink task should be 
the last in the chain. In fact, any task (except the source task) can be executed more than once with the same or
different parameters. For example, one could write a full resolution data to one measurement set, then average to 
a lower resolution and write the result to a different measurement set. We plan to use this feature eventually
for the on-the-fly calibration. 

.. image:: figures/ingest_overview.png

If used in the parallel (MPI) mode, the same task chain is replicated for each MPI rank to enable parallel processing.
Source tasks are rank aware and increment accordingly the UDP port number which they listen to get the visiblity data. 
This allows us to have separate data streams processed by different ranks of ingest pipeline. By default, each rank does
exactly the same operations according to the task chain but acts on a different portion of data. 
Therefore, the number of measurement
sets written by the *ingest pipeline* is tied down to the number of ranks running the  **MS Sink** task. The file 
name of the created measurement set can have a suffix added to distinguish between measurement sets written by different 
ranks. More than one file is usually required to increase the writing throughput. By default, all ranks always receive
data (i.e. execute an appropriate **Source** task). However, later down the processing chain, each
rank can be activated and deactivated by special type tasks which rearrange the data flow and parallelisation.
If the given rank is not active, data are not passed through the task chain for this rank. This can be used to inhibit data
writing for a subset of ranks. In particular, we use this feature of the task interface (see *Merge* task for details)
to aggregade more bandwidth than is defined by the natural hardware-based distribution (one stream normally 
covers 4 MHz of bandwidth produced by a single correlator card). In the future, we envisage also to have 
tasks which would fork data streams to allow more parallel processing (e.g. a separate measurement set for 
calibration can be prepared in parallel). It is also possible to add so called service ranks (see below) which are not 
receiving any data. These ranks are deactivated by default and could be used for additional processing later on 
if some task activates them. 

Configuration Parameters
------------------------

The program requires a configuration file be provided on the command line. This
section describes the valid parameters. In addition to mandatory parameters which are
always required, individual tasks often have specific parameters which need to be
defined only if a particular task is used.

|                            |                   |            |is important for the following reasons: hardware sends data in|

|                            |                   |            |to assign service ranks on those nodes which do not receive   |

Beam arrangement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameters describing the beam arrangement are similar to the *feeds* configuration of :doc:`../../calim/csimulator`.
It is mainly used to initialise **FEED** table of the measurement set, but also used by calculation of the phase centres and
projected baseline coordinates (uvw's) if appropriate tasks are included in the chain. All beams are dual polarisation and
linearly polarised (hard coded). Note, the term *feed* in the context of measurement sets really means *beam*.

Antenna layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Parameters describing antenna array configuration are similar to *antennas* section 
of :doc:`../../calim/csimulator` configuration.
It is used as a source of data to initialise **ANTENNA** table of the measurement set, but also used by calculation of 
the projected baseline coordinates (uvw's) if appropriate tasks are included in the chain. Only antennas referred to
from the *baselinemap* end up listed in the **ANTENNA** table (and therefore get an index in the measurement set), other
antennas are simply ignored (as they don't participate in the particular measurement and don't contribute to the data 
written or processed past the source task). This section of the configuration is a slice of the antenna information
stored by Facility Configuration Manager (FCM) and often contains parameters which are ignored by the ingest pipeline
(e.g. the aboriginal name or pointing parameters) in addition to antennas unused in the particular experiment.

Baseline map

This section of parameters describes mapping between the output of the correlator and physical correlations stored in the

Correlator modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes the data expected from the correlator. It is largely inherited from BETA and some future changes
are expected in this area to support different frequency tunings of ASKAP. For the parallel environment, the description 
applies to single card only. Different configurations of the input data could change in run time, but all possible
configurations should be defined up front (so the appropriate **SPECTRAL_WINDOW** table can be created).
