# This script takes care of tasks that need to be run either upon
# completion of all jobs from a single processASKAP.sh call, or can be
# run once all jobs have been submitted to the queue (and hence their
# job IDs are known). 
# Included here are:
#  * Creation of a user script to indicate progress of queued jobs.
#  * Creation of a user script to kill all launched jobs
