# Launches a job to convert any CASA images into FITS
# format. This job is launched as an array job, with one job for each
# potential image (this list is defined when the processASKAP script is
# called, so the CASA images don't necessarily exist - if they don't
# exist at run-time, nothing is done by that individual job).
# The FITS headers are populated with the PROJECT keyword.
