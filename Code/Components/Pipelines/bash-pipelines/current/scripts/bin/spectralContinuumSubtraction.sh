# Subtracts the continuum emission from the spectral-line dataset in
# one of two ways: one by finding & fitting components in the restored
# continuum image (using Selavy), making a model image of those
# components with Cmodel, and the subtracting from the measurement
# set; or two by using the continuum clean model to subtract from the
# measurement set.
