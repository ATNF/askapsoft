/// @brief task for running another task in a parallel thread
/// @details This task is a wrapper around any other task known to the ingest pipeline.
/// Except for the first chunk of data which is just passed to the child task as is
/// (to allow adjustment to the actual configuration of the parallel streams within the
/// ingest pipeline), this task makes the copy of the data, buffers them and executes the
/// child task in a parallel thread. Provided the execution time plus copy overheads 
/// do not exceed the cycle time, this allows better utilisation of resources and more
/// distributed computing. The child task should obey the following conditions (otherwise,
/// ingesting will not work correctly and may even lock up):
///    * it should not modify the data
///    * it should not alter the distribution of data streams (except on the first cycle)
/// For example, MSSink or TCPSink are suitable while ChannelAvgTask or BeamScatterTask are not.
/// The code has limited ability to detect misuse, so it is largely up to an expert user to 
/// configure ingest pipeline correctly to avoid problems. This task supports  a couple of
/// different strategies deailg with the processing not keeping up: throw an exception, 
/// skip the data.
///
/// Parameters (example):
///   child = MSSink  (child task, same name as understood in tasklist)
///   lossless = true (if not allowed to skip data in the not-keeping up case)
///   size = 1 (circular buffer size)
///   maxwait = 20 (maximum waiting time in seconds for the child task to complete)
