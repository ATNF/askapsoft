test_ingest

This functional test is an integration test between Correlator Simulator and Ingest.

The parent script is "run.sh".

This script is responsible for:
- cleaning up old results
- setting parameters in parsets:
	- playback.in: correlator simulator
	- cpingest.in: ingest
- starting ICE services
- calling children scripts in a coordinated way: 
	- run_corrsim.sh: executes correlator simulator
	- run_ingest.sh : executes ingest
- stopping ICE services

Usage:

./run.sh <number of cards>

<number of cards> =
1		: Only 1 ingest process is run (serial mode)
2~96	: Ingest process is run in parallel (= the number of cards).
		  Note that the maximum is 96, which is 8 blocks x 12 cards per block.
other	: error
When the argument is missing a usage statement will be produced:

> ./run.sh
>
> The number of cards used in streaming the data must be specified.
> Usage: ./run.sh <number of cards = 1~96>
