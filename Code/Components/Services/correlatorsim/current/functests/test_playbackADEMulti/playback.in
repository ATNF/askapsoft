# Configuration file for playing back Telescope Operating System Simulator
# (tossim) and Correlator Simulator (corrsim).

# Parameters for both

# Correlator cycle time in seconds

# "test" will invoke test procedure, which takes more time & memory.

# Correlator Simulator configuration
#
# Total number of antennas to be simulated.

# copied from existing antennas.
# Range: 1 (default) to 36 (max for ASKAP)

# If the number is greater than that in measurement set, data will be 
# copied from existing coarse channels.

# Default: 54

# TO ADD LATER: Failure pattern (make sure repeatable, ie. not random)
#
# NOTE
# - In this version (ADE version), baseline map is computed automatically.
#   In previous version (BETA version), such map must be provided 
#   explicitly in this file.
