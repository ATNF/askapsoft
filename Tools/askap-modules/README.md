# ASKAP Modules
Note: Modules, as in Environment Modules, for configuring an environment. See http://modules.sourceforge.net.

This folder does not contain references to all ASKAP modules, which are generally built using the normal rbuild process. It does, however,
contain code that would not otherwise be held anywhere else.

See https://confluence.csiro.au/display/ASDP/ASKAP+modules+at+Pawsey

The ASKAP modulefiles are of two types: static ones and versioned ones.

The modulefiles for 

* askapsoft
* askapcli
* askappipeline
* askapservices 

are versioned and generated by the `Tools/Dev/deploy/ASKAPSDP-deploy.sh` script
from templates in that package.

This package contains the other module files which are single definitions that are more static like:

* askapsofthook
* askaputils
* askap-cray (currently deployed as `/group/askap/modulefiles/askap-cray/current`)
* askapdata (currently deployed as `/group/askap/modulefiles/askapdata/current`)
* askapvis (currently deployed as `/group/askap/modulefiles/askapvis/current`)
* bbcp (currently deployed as `/group/askap/modulefiles/bbcp/13.05.03.00.0`)
