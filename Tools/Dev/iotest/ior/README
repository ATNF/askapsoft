Automate a series of IOR tests

run.sh: 
Bash shell script to load python modules and call run.py

run.py: 
Creates IOR script and SLURM batch file, as well as submitting the later
Python

batch file: 
Prepares environment for IOR script and executes it
Created by run.py

IOR script: 
Contains the options for a specific IOR execution
Created by run.py


TODO:

Instead of hard-coding the test series parameters into run.py,
put them in test parameter file.
The format extends that of IOR script.
The only difference is that the parameter to vary is in this format:

transferSize = [100m, 200m, 300m]

The number of tests is inferred (3 in this example).
