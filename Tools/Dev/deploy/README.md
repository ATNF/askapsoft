# ASKAP DEPLOY
This script is only for deploying askap artefacts to the Galaxy platform at the Pawsey Supercomputing centre and is intended as
a script for admins of that system only or for use in a continuous integration environment for that platform. This script is of
no use to anyone else.

The script should be deployed to the askapops user area with suitable permissions to prevent changes and enforce private use
by askapops only (chmod 700).

More to come ...
