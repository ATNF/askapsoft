# Note that this library also has a dependency on libpq, the PostgreSQL C client
# library. On my Debian test system I obtained this via the packages libpq5 and
# libpq-dev. On Galaxy we need to decide whether to use system packages or to
# add the source to 3rdParty. Not doing this yet as it is only required if
# Postgresql is selected as the production backend.
