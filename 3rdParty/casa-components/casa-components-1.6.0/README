casacore versions 2 and above pull out the components module on the basis that it is to casa specific

So the question over what to do has been posed. The components module is now part of casa and not provided
standalone. This means that the simplest solution is probably to pull the latest version of it from the casa
build and freeze it here. I say the latest version as - the choice we have is either keep with 1.6 in components or 
move forwards....
